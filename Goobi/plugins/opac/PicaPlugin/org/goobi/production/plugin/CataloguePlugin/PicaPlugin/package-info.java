 * The package PicaPlugin contains the classes required to access a PICA

 *    void    configure(Map) [*]
 *    Object  find(String, long)
 *    String  getDescription() [*]
 *    Map     getHit(Object, long, long)

 * org.goobi.production.plugin.CataloguePlugin.CataloguePlugin.
 * 
 * Most of the code originates form the package <kbd>de.unigoettingen.sub.
 * search.opac</kbd> created by “Ludwig” and maybe others in 2005. The plugin
 * classes can be compiled with the libraries from /Goobi/WEB-INF/lib and the
 * Tomcat server runtime libraries on the classpath.
